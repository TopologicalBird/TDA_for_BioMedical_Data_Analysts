# **TDA for BioMedical Data Analysts**

## **TDA in BioMedicine**
The analysis and quantitative evaluation of data shapes are crucial processes in biomedical data analysis, particularly for microscopic cell images, CT scans of organs, pathology slide images, and spatial transcriptomics. Thus, it is easy to see how topology, the study of shapes, can play a vital role in this field. This potential is being realized as researchers report various biomedical data analysis results using topological methods, including studies on hepatic lesions in CT scans, brain artery morphologies, neuron structures, C. elegans movements, cell segmentation tools, and transcriptomics analysis techniques.

However, only a limited number of biomedical data analysts fully utilize topology in their work. One reason for this gap may be the scarcity of learning materials that address both the theoretical and practical aspects of topological data analysis in an interactive manner, which poses a significant barrier to self-learning in this area. The author, who has an educational background in biomedicine, believes that simply applying topological data analysis to biomedical data is insufficient for fully leveraging the complex and diverse datasets in this field. Successfully interacting with both the mathematical framework and the biomedical data is essential for achieving favorable outcomes. While this may seem complex, obtaining the necessary skills and knowledge is not as difficult as it appears when provided with suitable learning materials.

In response to this gap, we present an interactive textbook on topological data analysis specifically designed for biomedical data analysts. This textbook will equip readers with the essential knowledge and skills needed for effective data analysis. We hope that this book will encourage the integration of topological data analysis and biomedical data analysis, ultimately leading to a revolutionary data analysis framework that would be otherwise unattainable.
