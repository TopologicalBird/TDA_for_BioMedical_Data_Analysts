# **TDA for BioMedical Data Analysts**

Welcome to TDA for BioMedical Data Analysts tutorial page! The tutorials in this page is currently under development. We will keep adding contents to the existing chapters and also upload missing chapters. If you have any comments or content suggestions, please contact the author.

## **TDA in BioMedicine**
The analysis and quantitative evaluation of data shapes are crucial processes in biomedical data analysis, particularly for microscopic cell images, CT scans of organs, pathology slide images, and spatial transcriptomics. Thus, it is easy to see how topology, the study of shapes, can play a vital role in this field. This potential is being realized as researchers report various biomedical data analysis results using topological methods.

However, only a limited number of biomedical data analysts fully utilize topology in their work. One reason for this gap may be the scarcity of learning materials that address both the theoretical and practical aspects of topological data analysis in an interactive manner, which poses a significant barrier to self-learning in this area. The author, who has an educational background in biomedicine, believes that simply applying topological data analysis to biomedical data is insufficient for fully leveraging the complex and diverse datasets in this field. Successfully interacting with both the mathematical framework and the biomedical data is essential for achieving favorable outcomes. While this may seem complex, obtaining the necessary skills and knowledge is not as difficult as it appears when provided with suitable learning materials.

In response to this gap, we present an interactive tutorial book on topological data analysis specifically designed for biomedical data analysts. This tutorial book will equip readers with the essential knowledge and skills needed for effective data analysis. We hope that this book will encourage the integration of topological data analysis and biomedical data analysis, ultimately leading to a revolutionary data analysis framework that would be otherwise unattainable.

## **About this tutorial book**

This tutorial book has been created as part of the interactive seminar materials for topological data analysis aimed at biomedical data analysts. Its unique feature is the effort to balance theory and application, ensuring that neither aspect is compromised. We will cover the essential concepts necessary for newcomers in this field, enabling them to engage with the framework on their own. The book is available online in the form of Jupyter notebooks, which include interactive code, with completely free of charge, and will be kept updated by the author.
